 Blue-Green Deployment Implementation

#### Introduction
The project aims to implement a blue-green deployment strategy for an application running on AWS infrastructure. The blue-green deployment approach will ensure minimal user downtime during application version updates and provide a seamless rollback mechanism in case of issues with the new version.

#### Project Components
The project involves setting up and configuring various AWS services and components, including:

1. **EC2 Instances**: These will host the application and be managed through an autoscaling group.
2. **CodeDeploy**: Used for automating the deployment of the application to the EC2 instances.
3. **CodePipeline**: Facilitates the creation of a continuous delivery pipeline for the application deployment process.
4. **S3**: The storage service used to store artifacts and facilitate their deployment through CodeDeploy.

#### Implementation Steps

##### 1. IAM Role Creation
- Create IAM roles for EC2 and CodeDeploy, granting them the necessary permissions, including access to the S3 bucket.

##### 2. EC2 Configuration
- Set up EC2 instances, autoscaling groups, launch templates or configurations, and load balancers to ensure high availability and scalability.

##### 3. S3 Bucket Creation
- Create an S3 bucket to store artifacts generated during the build process and to be used for deployment.

##### 4. CodeDeploy Application and Deployment Group Setup
- Create a CodeDeploy application and configure a deployment group, selecting the blue-green deployment strategy and associating it with the EC2 autoscaling group.

##### 5. CodePipeline Configuration
- Set up a CodePipeline, connecting it to the application's source code repository, specifying the S3 bucket as the artifact store, and integrating it with CodeDeploy to automate the deployment process.

##### 6. Agent and Application Verification
- Ensure that the CodeDeploy agent is successfully running on the EC2 instances and verify the deployment of the application to the instances.

#### Conclusion
By implementing the blue-green deployment strategy using AWS services, the project aims to achieve seamless and reliable application updates, ensuring minimal disruption to end users and providing the capability to quickly rollback to the previous version in case of issues. The project will demonstrate the effective use of AWS infrastructure and services to enhance deployment processes and maintain high availability of the application.

The successful completion of the project will showcase the benefits of blue-green deployment in a production environment and provide a solid foundation for future deployments and infrastructure management.
